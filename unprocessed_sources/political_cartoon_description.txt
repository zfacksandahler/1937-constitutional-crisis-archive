Political Cartoon: 'The Court-Packer'

Date: March 1937
Artist: Unknown (likely published in major newspaper)

Description: A cartoon depicting President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a giant figure towering over the Supreme Court building. He is shown holding a large stamp labeled 'Court-Packing Plan' and preparing to stamp it onto the building, which is represented as a small, fragile structure. The Justices are depicted as small, frightened figures scurrying away. The caption reads: 'A New Deal for the Court?'

The cartoon captures the public perception of FDR's aggressive attempt to reshape the judiciary. It reflects the controversy surrounding the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, which would have allowed the President to appoint up to six additional justices to the Supreme Court.
