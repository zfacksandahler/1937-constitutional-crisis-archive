WEST COAST HOTEL CO. v. PARRISH, 300 U.S. 379 (1937)

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question before us is the validity of the minimum wage law of the State of Washington. The appellant, a hotel company, contends that the statute violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals of the State of Washington upheld the statute, and the case comes here on appeal.

The principle that must control here is not in doubt. The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation, the Constitution does not recognize an absolute and uncontrollable liberty.

The liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people. Legislation to that end is within the state's power.

The judgment is affirmed.
