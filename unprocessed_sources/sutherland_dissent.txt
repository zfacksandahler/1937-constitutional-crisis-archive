Dissenting Opinion of Justice Sutherland in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish

The majority today upholds a statute that, in my view, flagrantly violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Constitution's guarantee of liberty includes the right to make contracts for one's labor, free from arbitrary governmental interference.

The statute here imposes a minimum wage, fixing by law the price at which an employee may sell his or her services. This is not a health or safety regulation; it is a wage‑fixing law, pure and simple. Such laws were struck down in Adkins v. Children's Hospital and Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo. The principle of stare decisis demands that we adhere to those precedents.

To allow the state to set wages is to allow it to control the very terms of employment, a power that belongs to individuals, not to the government. The Court's abandonment of this principle marks a dangerous departure from our constitutional traditions.

I respectfully dissent.
