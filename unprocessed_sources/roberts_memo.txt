Confidential Memorandum

Reflections on West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish

My vote in this case has been the subject of much speculation. Let me state clearly: my decision was not influenced by external pressure. It was a matter of legal principle.

The Court's prior decisions, such as Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, had established a rigid doctrine of freedom of contract that left no room for reasonable regulation of wages. Upon further reflection, I have come to believe that this doctrine was mistaken. The Constitution does not forbid a state from enacting minimum wage legislation for the protection of women and workers.

The line between permissible regulation and unconstitutional infringement must be drawn with regard to the actual conditions of modern industrial life. The State of Washington's law is a reasonable exercise of its police power.

I stand by my vote.
