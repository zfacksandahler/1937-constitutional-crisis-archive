March 9, 1937 - Fireside Chat on the Judiciary Reorganization Bill

My friends, I want to talk with you very simply tonight about the need for present action in this crisis—the need to meet the unanswered challenge of one-third of a nation ill-nourished, ill-clad, ill-housed.

The Constitution of the United States was a layman's document, not a lawyer's contract. That is why it has been the charter of our liberties. But we cannot allow the Constitution to become a barrier to progress. The Court has been acting as a super‑legislature, reading into the Constitution words and implications which are not there, and which were never intended to be there.

I am proposing that when any judge or justice of any federal court has reached the age of seventy and does not retire within six months, the President shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint one additional judge or justice to that court. This will bring to the bench new blood, new energy, and a fresh perspective.

We must save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself.
